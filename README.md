# ILP-Calculation

Author: hoga85
Date: 31 Oct 2017


The script, 'SAR_calculate.R', allows users to calculate the ILP/SAR of magnetic nano-particles. 
The specific heat capacity of the sample is assumed to be the same as water, i.e., 4.186  joule/gram Â°C.

*The format of the data can be found in the 'Sample_Data.txt'. 

*The results include a pdf and two csv files. While the pdf graphically expresses the SAR/ILP, the csv files states the temperature variation during the measurement and the detailed values of SAR/ILP. 

The algorithm is based on the paper published by (Wildeboer, 2014).
